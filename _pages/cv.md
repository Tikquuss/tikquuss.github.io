I'm a 2nd year PhD Student in computer science at [Université de Montréal (UdeM)](https://www.umontreal.ca/) and [Mila](https://mila.quebec/) (Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute); supervised by [Guillaume Rabusseau](https://www-labs.iro.umontreal.ca/~grabus/) and [Guillaume Dumas](http://www.extrospection.eu/). 

[comment]: <> I fast-tracked from master's to PhD. $^{\text{August 2022 – August 2023}}$ 

I am interested in understanding generalization and optimization in deep learning, both from dynamical systems and neuroscience perspectives. My main interest is understanding what causes the triplet (model, optimization, data properties) to generalize beyond the training set, the causal relationship between complexity measures, initialization, hyperparameters and generalization, the functional metrics (progression measures) that differentiate a neuronal network before and after learning.

Before starting a PhD, I was a visiting student researcher at UdeM and a reseach intern at Mila. I worked under the supervision of professor [Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/en/) and his postdoctoral fellow [Dianbo Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kGSzBpMAAAAJ&hl=en) on [Biasly](https://mila.quebec/projet/biasly/) (detecting and mitigating racist and sexist discrimination in online texts). 

[comment]: <> $^{\text{September 2021 – September 2022}}$

I hold a master's of engineering in computer science from the National Advanced School of Engineering Yaounde, Cameroon. 

[comment]: <>  $^{\text{September 2016 – July 2021}}$

[comment]: <> !🌱 I am very passionate about philosophy (I'm a stoic, in the sense of Marcus Aurelius), physics (quantum physics, gravitation theory and cosmology) and sport. I do body building, muay thai (Thailang boxing) and MMA (Mixed Martial Arts).

[comment]: <> !💬 If you have an interesting book to recommend, don't hesitate.

PROFESSIONAL SERVICES
======
* Machine Translation of local African languages
  * I am one of the first people to have tackled machine translation of Cameroonian local languages : we have released a dataset of 22 Cameroonian local languages, trained and put into production unsupervised (denoising auto-encoder + online back-translation) multilingual (XLM) machine translation models (adapted to low-resource languages such as those of Africa)
  * Ongoing Related Projects : tools (BLEU, tokenizer..) for morphologically complex languages such as those of Africa and speech2speech (train a model to translate a speech from one language to another).
