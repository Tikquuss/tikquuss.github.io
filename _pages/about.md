About me
========

I'm a Visiting Student researcher at [Université de Montréal (UdeM)](https://www.umontreal.ca/), Department of Computer Science and Operations Research (DIRO); and a machine learning research assistant at [MILA](https://mila.quebec/), Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute. I worked under the supervision of professor Yoshua Bengio and his postdoctoral fellow Dianbo Liu on [Biasly](https://mila.quebec/projet/biasly/) (detecting and mitigating racist and sexist discrimination in online texts), from January 2021 to January 2022. Currently I am working under the supervision of professor Irina Rish and professor [Guillaume Dumas](http://www.extrospection.eu/) on scaling and phase transitions in natural language processing algorithms. I hold a master's of engineering in computer science from the [National Advanced School of Engineering Yaounde, Cameroon](https://polytechnique.cm/).

My research area in machine learning includes attention mechanism, transform-based models, neural language modeling and neural machine translation, multimodal and mutitask learning, meta learning and curriculum learning, automatic speech recognition and speech synthesis. I am also interested in (but not directly working on) computer vision, reinforcement learning, graph neural network, systemic generalization, federated learning, robustness in machine learning ...


I am very passionate about philosophy (I'm a stoic, in the sense of Marcus Aurelius) and physics (theoretical, especially quantum physics, gravitation theory and cosmology).

As a sport, I do body building (I became addicted to it) and muay thai / thai boxing (Thailang boxing).

If you have an interesting book to recommend, don't hesitate.
