[comment]: <> !#About me
[comment]: <> !========

I'm a Visiting Student researcher at [UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al (UdeM)](https://www.umontreal.ca/), Department of Computer Science and Operations Research (DIRO); and a machine learning research assistant at [MILA](https://mila.quebec/), Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute. I worked under the supervision of professor [Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/en/) and his postdoctoral fellow [Dianbo Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kGSzBpMAAAAJ&hl=en) on [Biasly](https://mila.quebec/projet/biasly/) (detecting and mitigating racist and sexist discrimination in online texts), from January 2021 to January 2022. Currently I am working under the supervision of professor [Irina Rish](https://sites.google.com/site/irinarish/) and professor [Guillaume Dumas](http://www.extrospection.eu/) on  scaling and phase transitions in natural language processing algorithms, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and [Generative Flow Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09266) (with professor Yoshua Bengio). I hold a master's of engineering in computer science from the [National Advanced School of Engineering Yaounde, Cameroon](https://polytechnique.cm/).

ðŸ”­ In the past, my research was focused on attention mechanism, transform-based models, neural language modeling and neural machine translation. Currently I am working on predicting phase transitions in large scale language models (you will find [here](https://github.com/Tikquuss/lm_grokking) my tutorial on how to pre-train a causal & mask language model with the huggingface transformers library), and on GflowNets (here is a tutorial I wrote about [GflowNets](https://github.com/Tikquuss/GflowNets_Tutorial)). For my Master and PhD project at UdeM & MILA, I will work on the use of global workspace theory and attention schema theory (social and cognitive neuroscience) to enable coordination among neural agents in a multi-agent environment.

[comment]: <> !multimodal and mutitask learning, meta learning and curriculum learning, automatic speech recognition and speech synthesis. I am also interested in (but not directly working on) computer vision, reinforcement learning, graph neural network, systemic generalization, federated learning, robustness in machine learning ...

ðŸŒ± I am very passionate about philosophy (I'm a stoic, in the sense of Marcus Aurelius) and physics (theoretical, especially quantum physics, gravitation theory and cosmology).

âš¡ As a sport, I do body building, muay thai (Thailang boxing) and MMA (Mixed Martial Arts).

ðŸ’¬ If you have an interesting book to recommend, don't hesitate.
