EDUCATION
======
* Visiting Student researcher, Université de Montréal (UdeM), October 2021 - Now
* Master's of Engineering in Computer Science, National Advanced School of Engineering Yaounde, Cameroon, September 2018 - July 2021
* Mathematics and Physical Sciences, National Advanced School of Engineering Yaounde, Cameroon, September 2016 - June 2018

PROFESSIONAL SERVICES
======
* Machine Translation of local African languages
  * I am one of the first people to have tackled machine translation of Cameroonian local languages : we have released a dataset of 22 Cameroonian local languages, trained and put into production unsupervised (denoising auto-encoder + online back-translation) multilingual (XLM) machine translation models (adapted to low-resource languages such as those of Africa)
  * Ongoing Related Projects : tools (BLEU, tokenizer..) for morphologically complex languages such as those of Africa and speech2speech (train a model to translate a speech from one language to another).
* Reviewer : 5th Black in AI Workshop (co-located with NeurIPS 2021)
* Member & Mentor : AI-Mentoring-ENSPY, a group that aims to guide our cadets at ENSPY in their learning of Artificial Intelligence, mainly the reading of scientific articles
