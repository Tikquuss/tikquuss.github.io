I".<h1 id="about-me">About me</h1>

<p>I’m a Visiting Student researcher at <a href="https://www.umontreal.ca/">Université de Montréal (UdeM)</a>, Department of Computer Science and Operations Research (DIRO); and a machine learning research assistant at <a href="https://mila.quebec/">MILA</a>, Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute. I worked under the supervision of professor Yoshua Bengio and his postdoctoral fellow Dianbo Liu on <a href="https://mila.quebec/projet/biasly/">Biasly</a> (detecting and mitigating racist and sexist discrimination in online texts), from January 2021 to January 2022. Currently I am working under the supervision of professor Irina Rish and professor <a href="http://www.extrospection.eu/">Guillaume Dumas</a> on scaling and phase transitions in natural language processing algorithms. I hold a master’s of engineering in computer science from the <a href="https://polytechnique.cm/">National Advanced School of Engineering Yaounde, Cameroon</a>.</p>

<p>My research area in machine learning includes attention mechanism, transform-based models, neural language modeling and neural machine translation, multimodal and mutitask learning, meta learning and curriculum learning, automatic speech recognition and speech synthesis. I am also interested in (but not directly working on) computer vision, reinforcement learning, graph neural network, systemic generalization, federated learning, robustness in machine learning …</p>

<p>I am very passionate about philosophy (I’m a stoic, in the sense of Marcus Aurelius) and physics (theoretical, especially quantum physics, gravitation theory and cosmology).</p>

<p>As a sport, I do body building (I became addicted to it) and muay thai / thai boxing (Thailang boxing).</p>

<p>If you have an interesting book to recommend, don’t hesitate.</p>
