I"=<p>While neural loss functions live in a very high-dimensional space, visualizations are only possible using low-dimensional 1D (line) or 2D (surface) plots. Several methods exist for closing this dimensionality gap. The idea is to choose a linear subspace that maximally preserves the optimization trajectory’s shape, in order to observe patterns that are meaningful in the full parameter space.</p>
