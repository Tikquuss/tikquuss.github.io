I am interested in understanding generalization and optimization in deep learning.</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>Before that I was a Visiting Student researcher at UdeM and a Reseach Intern at Mila : I worked under the supervision of professor <a href="https://yoshuabengio.org/en/">Yoshua Bengio</a> and his postdoctoral fellow <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kGSzBpMAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Dianbo Liu</a> on <a href="https://mila.quebec/projet/biasly/">Biasly</a> (detecting and mitigating racist and sexist discrimination in online texts).</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>I hold a master’s of engineering in computer science from the <a href="https://polytechnique.cm/">National Advanced School of Engineering Yaounde, Cameroon</a>.</p>
