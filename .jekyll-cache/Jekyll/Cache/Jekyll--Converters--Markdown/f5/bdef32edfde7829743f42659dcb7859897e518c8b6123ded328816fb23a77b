<p>Iâ€™m a MSc Student at <a href="https://www.umontreal.ca/">UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al (UdeM)</a>, Department of Computer Science and Operations Research (DIRO); and  <a href="https://mila.quebec/">Mila</a>, Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute.</p>

<p>Before that I was a Visiting Student researcher at UdeM and Mila : I worked under the supervision of professor <a href="https://yoshuabengio.org/en/">Yoshua Bengio</a> and his postdoctoral fellow <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kGSzBpMAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Dianbo Liu</a> on <a href="https://mila.quebec/projet/biasly/">Biasly</a> (detecting and mitigating racist and sexist discrimination in online texts), and under the supervision of professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/irinarish/">Irina Rish</a> and professor <a href="http://www.extrospection.eu/">Guillaume Dumas</a> on Phase Transitions and Emergent Behaviors in Deep Learning.</p>

<p>I hold a masterâ€™s of engineering in computer science from the <a href="https://polytechnique.cm/">National Advanced School of Engineering Yaounde, Cameroon</a>.</p>

<p>ðŸ”­ In the past, my research was focused on neural language modeling and neural machine translation.</p>

<p>ðŸŒ± I am very passionate about philosophy (Iâ€™m a stoic, in the sense of Marcus Aurelius), physics (quantum physics, gravitation theory and cosmology) and sport. I do body building, muay thai (Thailang boxing) and MMA (Mixed Martial Arts).</p>
