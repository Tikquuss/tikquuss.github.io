<p>Iâ€™m a PhD Student at <a href="https://www.umontreal.ca/">UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al (UdeM)</a>, Department of Computer Science and Operations Research (DIRO); and  <a href="https://mila.quebec/">Mila</a>, Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute; supervised by <a href="https://irina-rish.com/">Irina Rish</a> and <a href="http://www.extrospection.eu/">Guillaume Dumas</a>. I am interested in understanding generalization and optimization in deep learning (DL) : what causes the triplet (model, optimization-SGD, data properties) to generalize beyond the training set?</p>

<p><br />
I fast-tracked from masterâ€™s to PhD. $^{\text{September 2022 â€“ September 2023}}$</p>

<p>Before that I was a Visiting Student researcher at UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al and a Reseach Intern at Mila : I worked under the supervision of professor <a href="https://yoshuabengio.org/en/">Yoshua Bengio</a> and his postdoctoral fellow <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kGSzBpMAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Dianbo Liu</a> on <a href="https://mila.quebec/projet/biasly/">Biasly</a> (detecting and mitigating racist and sexist discrimination in online texts). $^{\text{September 2021 â€“ September 2022}}$</p>

<p><br />
I hold a masterâ€™s of engineering in computer science from the <a href="https://polytechnique.cm/">National Advanced School of Engineering Yaounde, Cameroon</a>. $^{\text{September 2018 â€“ July 2021}}$</p>
